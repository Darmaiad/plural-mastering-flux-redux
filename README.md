# Mastering Flux & Redux (Pluralsight)

This project is based on the excellent [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course [Mastering Flux and Redux](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/flux-redux-mastering/table-of-contents) by [Daniel Stern](https://github.com/danielstern).

The course taught Flux and Redux by means of developing a coding project using Javascript ES6 and custom implementations of state management. While it was great for learning purpoces, I decided to re-develop the project using the actual frameworks.

So, I used [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Flux-Utils](https://github.com/facebook/flux), [React-Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux),[React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started.html) and after I reorginized the code in files/folders following the common practices of the aforementioned frameworks, I deliver this project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

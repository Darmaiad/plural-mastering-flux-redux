# Mastering Flux & Redux (Pluralsight)
This project is based on the [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course: [Mastering Flux and Redux](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/flux-redux-mastering/table-of-contents) by [Daniel Stern](https://github.com/danielstern).

## Installation
Assuming you have `npm` & `node.js` installed, you can either clone or download the repository. Navigate to the folder that you/was created. Then, run `npm install` on the command line to download the dependencies. Finally, run `npm start` to launch to the project.

## Description
The course taught Flux and Redux by means of developing a coding project using Javascript ES6 and custom implementations of state management. While it was great for learning purpoces, I decided to re-develop the project using the actual frameworks.

So, I reorginized the code in files/folders following the common practices. Then, I used [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Flux-Utils](https://github.com/facebook/flux), [React-Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux), [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started.html) to re-write the whole project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
